<p>Whilst running low on food supplies, Luffy, Zoro and Nami are suddenly attacked by a strange sea creature who destroys their boat and captures Nami. Washing up on a nearby island, Luffy and Zoro meet a girl named Medaka, learning from her grandfather that her father, along with many others in the islands village, have been captured by the pirate Gyanzack, who is forcing them to build a huge cannon. With the incentive of food, Luffy and Zoro attack Gyanzack's hideout, only to wind up captured. However, their attempts inspire the villagers to fight back, allowing Nami to spring Luffy and Zoro free. Gyanzack soon attempts to flee on his ship, using his new cannon to bomb the island, but the combined efforts of Luffy, Zoro, Nami and Medaka put a stop to his plan.
